### Abstract
This work addresses the limitations of Kubernetes’ centralized, heuristic-based scheduler in managing heterogeneous, priority-sensitive workloads at scale. It proposes a decentralized, 
federated multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that enables adaptive, priority-aware pod placement using local node intelligence. The approach optimizes scheduling decisions by 
jointly considering pod priority, resource efficiency, and scheduling latency while integrating seamlessly with existing Kubernetes APIs. Experimental evaluation on realistic microservices
workloads demonstrates improved priority satisfaction, throughput, and scalability compared to traditional and learning-based schedulers.

### Key Contributions
- **Multimodal Observability Framework for I/O Bottleneck Detection:**
  Proposed a structured observability architecture that overcomes the limitations of single-modal monitoring by integrating metrics, logs, and traces into a unified model for distributed data pipelines.
  
- **Cross-Layer Correlation of I/O Behavior:**
  Introduced a correlation mechanism that aligns low-level Input/Output signals with execution paths and system events, enabling accurate localization of bottlenecks across storage, network, and application layers.
  
- **Pipeline-Wide Bottleneck Identification Methodology:**
  Developed a systematic approach to distinguish true Input/Output bottlenecks from secondary performance symptoms by analyzing interactions across pipeline stages under dynamic workloads.
   
- **End-to-End Design, Implementation, and Experimental Evaluation:**
  Designed, implemented, and validated the framework using distributed pipeline simulations across multiple cluster sizes, demonstrating consistent reductions in request completion time compared to baseline observability approaches.
  
### Relevance & Real-World Impact
- **Improved Precision in Bottleneck Diagnosis:**
  Significantly reduced misattribution of performance issues by enabling precise identification of Input/Output bottlenecks through multimodal signal correlation.
   
- **Faster and More Reliable Performance Troubleshooting:**
Enabled quicker diagnosis and mitigation of performance degradation, reducing operational delays caused by fragmented observability and manual analysis.

- **Scalable Observability for Distributed and Cloud-Native Pipelines:**
    Demonstrated effectiveness across varying cluster sizes and workload intensities, maintaining diagnostic accuracy as coordination overhead and I/O contention evolve with scale.
  
  **Operational Stability Under Dynamic Workloads:**
  Improved system stability by providing continuous visibility into shifting I/O contention patterns, supporting proactive performance management instead of reactive tuning.
   
- **Production and Research Applicability:**
    Delivered a framework compatible with modern distributed and cloud native environments, offering a complete reference model architecture, implementation, and evaluation suitable
    for industry observability platforms, academic research, and advanced systems education.
